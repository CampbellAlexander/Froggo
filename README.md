# Summary
Froggo is a 3D game developed in Unity where the player
hops around a swamp, collecting as many flies as it can before
the deadly crow runs in and eats you. The game is adapted
from a [TeamTreeHouse project](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/how-to-make-a-video-game-2)
but has been customized to be much more difficult and contains
automatic saving of your high score.
